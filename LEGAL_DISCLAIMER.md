## Medical Disclaimer

### AI Analysis Limitations

**THE AI CLINICAL ANALYSIS SYSTEM IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY**

1. **Not a Substitute for Professional Medical Advice**
   - AI suggestions are probabilistic, not diagnostic
   - All medical decisions MUST be made by licensed healthcare professionals
   - Patients should never rely solely on AI recommendations

2. **Accuracy Limitations**
   - Speech-to-text may mishear critical information
   - AI pattern matching has inherent error rates
   - Medical conditions are complex and require human judgment

3. **Liability Concerns**
   - If AI fails to detect a critical condition → Patient harm → Legal liability
   - If transcription errors lead to wrong medication → Malpractice lawsuit
   - If system recommends "no hospital visit" for serious condition → Wrongful death claim

## Real-World Examples of Risks

### Example 1: Transcription Error
```
Patient says: "I have NO chest pain"
System hears: "I have chest pain"
AI recommends: Hospital visit for cardiac evaluation
Result: Unnecessary emergency visit, patient anxiety, wasted resources
```

### Example 2: Missed Critical Symptom
```
Patient says: "slight discomfort in chest"
AI classifies: Low severity
Reality: Early stage heart attack
Result: Delayed treatment, potential patient death, massive lawsuit
```

### Example 3: Medication Allergy
```
Transcript mishears: "no allergy to penicillin" as "allergy to penicillin"
Doctor prescribes: Alternative antibiotic (more expensive, more side effects)
Result: Suboptimal treatment, increased costs
```
